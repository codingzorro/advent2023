# advent2023

A project designed to learn and explain how to write simple but
"conventional" programs with Clojure.  "Conventional" means something like
"non-functional", i.e., programs with a "do this and then do that and then do
that" workflow, as opposed to your typical kata to do some very sophisticated
transformation to one data structure.
